<h1>Personal Cybersecurity:</h1>
<br/>

<h2>Browser Tips for Websites Requiring Personal Data (e.g. banks)</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>Ensure URL at top has "https://" and lock symbol.</li>
    <li>Ensure domain is not misspelled, e.g. avoid http://bank0famerica.com.</li>
    <li>Have only one browser tab open (a malicious website in another tab may do harm).</li>
    <li>Close browser after completing online transaction (stops any running scripts, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>Email Safety</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>Note that the "From" email address is easily faked: don't trust it.</li>
    <li>Note that link text can be different from where the link actually leads.</li>
    <li>Hover mouse over link and look at bottom left of browser to see where link leads.</li>
    <li>If email looks suspicious, delete it (even opening an email may verify to sender that the email reached you: e.g. when browser downloads linked images).</li>
    <li>Don't risk downloading or opening suspicious attachments.</li>
    <li>If you must open an attachment, then select a known program instead of double-clicking: right-click -> open with -> notepad, pdf reader, word, etc.</li>
    <li>When replying, check that all To, CC, and BCC addresses are legitimate.</li>
    <li>Slighly more advanced is to check email headers.  In Gmail: open email -> click three dots (top right) -> "Show Original."</li>
    <li>Search for the sender domain, e.g. aol.com for john@aol.com, which should be throughout the headers: return path, auth results, etc.</li>
    <li>The headers check does not help much for cloud-hosted accounts, but can still show hints: e.g. suspicious email path.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>Passwords</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>Change regularly (make a calendar reminder, e.g. for once a year).</li>
    <li>Change if you see anything suspicious on your account or if you accidentally share any part of it.</li>
    <li>Change default passwords: e.g. routers and other devices use default passwords that anyone can find online.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>Backups</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>Either automate backups or make a calendar reminder to backup to two or three places: flash drives, external disks, etc.</li>
    <li>Systems crash, disks get dropped and damanaged, hackers encrypt drives (ransomware).  It's good to have a backup.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>Encrypt Drives</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>Encrypt any medium that stores confidential data.  Many new operating systems do this by default.</li>
    <li>Encrypt removable media.  If you lose a laptop or flash drive, others will not see your data.</li>
    <li>It's best not to put confidential data into the cloud, but if need be, encrypt files.</li>
    <li>As of this writing Google drive doesn't have an encrypt feature, so encrypt locally prior to uploading to cloud.</li>
    <li>E.g. LibreOffice Writer (roughly open source version of MS Word): File -> Properties -> Security -> Protect.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>Air Gap</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>If you are not using the internet for an extended period: disconnect.  E.g. disable network or default route.</li>
    <li>If your are not connected to the internet then hackers cannot attack you from afar nor can you leak confidential data.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>General Idea:</h2>
Check that destination of outgoing information is legitimate: URL you are going to, phone you are calling, email you are sending data to, bank account you are depositing into, etc.
