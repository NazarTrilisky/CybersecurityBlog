<h1>Personal Cybersecurity:</h1>

<h2>Browser Tips for Websites Requiring Personal Data (e.g. banks)</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>Ensure URL at top has "https://" and lock symbol.</li>
    <li>Ensure domain is not misspelled, e.g. avoid http://bank0famerica.com.</li>
    <li>Have only one browser tab open (a malicious website in another tab may do harm).</li>
    <li>Close browser after completing online transaction (stops any running scripts, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>Email Safety</h2>
<ol class="list-numbered">
    <li>Note that the "From" email address is easily faked: don't trust it.</li>
    <li>Note that link text can be different from where the link actually leads.</li>
    <li>Hover mouse over link and look at bottom left of browser to see where link leads.</li>
    <li>If email looks suspicious, delete it (even opening an email may verify to sender that the email reached you: e.g. when browser downloads linked images).</li>
    <li>Don't risk downloading or opening suspicious attachments.</li>
    <li>If you must open an attachment, then select a known program instead of double-clicking: right-click -> open with -> notepad, pdf reader, word, etc.</li>
    <li>When replying, check that all To, CC, and BCC addresses are legitimate.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h2>General Idea:</h2>
Check that destination of outgoing information is legitimate: URL you are going to, phone you are calling, email you are sending data to, bank account you are depositing into, etc.
